Fig. A8 gives the current taken by a complete unit, including all associated ancillary equipment. These lamps depend on the luminous electrical discharge through a gas or vapour of a metallic compound, which is contained in a hermetically-sealed transparent envelope at a pre-determined pressure.

But faults on underground cables are invariably permanent and take longer time to locate and repair.\\n\\nA loop architecture (see Fig. B10) correctly instrumented with fault detectors and motorized load break switches allow within a short period of time to identify a faulty cable, to disconnect it and to restore the supply to the whole substations included in the loop.\\n\\nThese procedures of faults detection, cables disconnection and supply restoration can be automatically performed in less than one minute by dedicated functions commonly integrated in remote control and monitoring systems of MV networks.\\n\\n# 1.4.3 Remote control and monitoring for MV networks (see Fig. B7)\\n\\nRemote control and monitoring of MV feeders make it possible to reduce loss of supply resulting from cable faults by supporting fast and effective loop reconfiguration. This facility relies on motorized switches associated with fault detectors on a number of substations in the loop and controlled by remote control units. All stations containing this equipment can have their supply restored remotely, whereas other stations will require additional manual operations.\\n\\nElectrical installation guide 2018 © Schneider Electric - all rights reserved'), Document(metadata={'file_size': 1031804, 'last_modified_at': '2025-02-08T12:34:21', 'file_path': 'Schneider_2018_small.pdf', 'file_name': 'Schneider_2018_small.pdf', 'external_file_id': 'Schneider_2018_small.pdf', 'file_id': 'e95aa0e4-a724-4fb7-9657-836519ab515d', 'pipeline_file_id': '6e8f09cb-3bdb-4312-aac2-9536435be726', 'pipeline_id': 'd42e94f1-972d-4b7d-99ec-5af1d540c623', 'page_label': 1, 'start_page_index': 0, 'start_page_label': 1, 'end_page_index': 0, 'end_page_label': 1, 'document_id': '1a37c32a2d258cae41793ceb72ed2d2e95d4332d81f73d6fbc', 'start_char_idx': 0, 'end_char_idx': 2485}, page_content='# A - General rules of electrical installation design\\n\\n# 3 Installed power loads - Characteristics\\n\\n|Type of lamp|Lamp power (W)|Current at 230 V (A)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Separated ballast lamp|10|0.080|\\n| |18|0.110|\\n| |26|0.150|\\n|Integrated ballast lamp|8|0.075|\\n| |11|0.095|\\n| |16|0.125|\\n| |21|0.170|\\n\\nFig. A7 Current demands and power consumption of compact fluorescent lamps (at 230 V-50 Hz)\\n\\n# 3.4 Discharge lamps\\n\\nSee also chapter N §4 \"Lighting circuits\". The power in watts indicated on the tube of a discharge lamp does not include the power dissipated in the ballast. Fig. A8 gives the current taken by a complete unit, including all associated ancillary equipment. These lamps depend on the luminous electrical discharge through a gas or vapour of a metallic compound, which is contained in a hermetically-sealed transparent envelope at a pre-determined pressure. These lamps have a long start-up time, during which the current Ia is greater than the nominal current In. Power and current demands are given for different types of lamp (typical average values which may differ slightly from one manufacturer to another).\\n\\n|Type of lamp|Power demand (W)|Current In(A)|PF not corrected|PF corrected|x In|Starting Period (mins)|Luminous efficiency (lumens per watt)|Average timelife of lamp (h)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|High-pressure sodium vapour lamps|50|60|0.76|0.3|1.4 to 1.6|4 to 6|80 to 120|9000|\\n| |70|80|1|0.45| | | |b Outdoor spaces|\\n| |100|115|1.2|0.65| | | |b Public lighting|\\n| |150|168|1.8|0.85| | | | |\\n| |250|274|3|1.4| | | | |\\n| |400|431|4.4|2.2| | | | |\\n| |1000|1055|10.45|4.9| | | | |\\n|Low-pressure sodium vapour lamps|26|34.5|0.45|0.17|1.1 to 1.3|7 to 15|100 to 200|8000 to|\\n| |36|46.5| |0.22| | | |12000|\\n| |66|80.5| |0.39| | | |b Security lighting, railway platforms|\\n| |91|105.5| |0.49| | | |b Platform, storage areas|\\n| |131|154| |0.69| | | | |\\n|Mercury vapour + metal halide (also called metal-iodide)|70|80.5|1|0.40|1.7|3 to 5|70 to 90|6000|\\n| |150|172|1.80|0.88| | | |6000|\\n| |250|276|2.10|1.35| | | |6000|\\n| |400|425|3.40|2.15| | | |6000|\\n| |1000|1046|8.25|5.30| | | |6000|\\n| |2000|2092|2052|16.5|8.60|10.50|6| |\\n|Mercury vapour + fluorescent substance (fluorescent bulb)|50|57|0.6|0.30|1.7 to 2|3 to 6|40 to 60|8000 to|\\n| |80|90|0.8|0.45| | | |12000|\\n| |125|141|1.15|0.70| | | | |\\n| |250|268|2.15|1.35| | | |b Outdoor lighting|\\n| |400|421|3.25|2.15| | | |b Low light output [a]|\\n| |700|731|5.4|3.85| | | | |\\n| |1000|1046|8.25|5.30| | | | |\\n|'), Document(metadata={'file_size': 1031804, 'last_modified_at': '2025-02-08T12:34:21', 'file_path': 'Schneider_2018_small.pdf', 'file_name': 'Schneider_2018_small.pdf', 'external_file_id': 'Schneider_2018_small.pdf', 'file_id': 'e95aa0e4-a724-4fb7-9657-836519ab515d', 'pipeline_file_id': '6e8f09cb-3bdb-4312-aac2-9536435be726', 'pipeline_id': 'd42e94f1-972d-4b7d-99ec-5af1d540c623', 'page_label': 1, 'start_page_index': 0, 'start_page_label': 1, 'end_page_index': 0, 'end_page_label': 1, 'document_id': '1a37c32a2d258cae41793ceb72ed2d2e95d4332d81f73d6fbc', 'start_char_idx': 2111, 'end_char_idx': 3135}, page_content='|6000|\\n| |2000|2092|2052|16.5|8.60|10.50|6| |\\n|Mercury vapour + fluorescent substance (fluorescent bulb)|50|57|0.6|0.30|1.7 to 2|3 to 6|40 to 60|8000 to|\\n| |80|90|0.8|0.45| | | |12000|\\n| |125|141|1.15|0.70| | | | |\\n| |250|268|2.15|1.35| | | |b Outdoor lighting|\\n| |400|421|3.25|2.15| | | |b Low light output [a]|\\n| |700|731|5.4|3.85| | | | |\\n| |1000|1046|8.25|5.30| | | | |\\n| |2000|2140|2080|15|11|6.1| | |\\n\\n[a] Replaced by sodium vapour lamps.\\n\\nNote: these lamps are sensitive to voltage dips. They extinguish if the voltage falls to less than 50 % of their nominal voltage, and will not re-ignite before cooling for approximately 4 minutes.\\n\\nNote: Sodium vapour low-pressure lamps have a light-output efficiency which is superior to that of all other sources. However, use of these lamps is restricted by the fact that the yellow-orange colour emitted makes colour recognition practically impossible.\\n\\nFig. A8 Current demands of discharge lamps\\n\\nElectrical installation guide 2018 © Schneider Electric - all rights reserved')], 'answer': 'Internal MV distribution describes a system where multiple secondary substations are supplied by a MV distribution circuit within the installation.
